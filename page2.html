    <div class="about">
        <p>I am currently an engineering student looking to complete my degree in the department of Electrical/Computer engineering at the University of British Columbia. 
        I am heavily inspired by technological advancments and its applications in its ability to make the world a better place. As a continuous learner and fan of the modern tech industry, I understand the only way to reach excellence is to absorb new information and build new foundations upon essential concepts constantly. 
        That being said, I also really enjoy my down time and love to exercise my passion of playing sports such as basketball and weightlifting as well as enjoy the new Netflix show here and there!</p>
